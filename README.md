# Web wallpaper generator #

This is a Javascript Canvas based system to generate randomly a new wallpaper.

See the [example](https://adrojo.com/ad_wallpaper/).

The project uses Canvas to generate the image based on circles and lines (creating mandalas and curvatures), changing the colors randomly and generates a png file.

Javascript detects the size of the screen of the device and make the Canvas double this size to mantain the quality of the image.

I hope you like it, I created this project also on Swift Playgrounds, so if you need it it's [here](https://github.com/adrojodev/Wallpaper-Generator-Swift-Playgrounds).

If you have any doubt or contribution, just send me an email, I'll answer the quickest I can. 

Enjoy!
